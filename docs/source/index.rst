Welcome to T3's documentation!
===================================

Tips and Tricks for Telemac (T3) is a cookbook meant to make life easier for new (and possibly more experienced) Telemac users. For the time being it is focused on  Telemac2D but other applications will come in time.

It will include a set of instructions to set up a new model, run simulations and process the results to obtain a viewer-friendly plots. Most of the documentation will rely on existing tools (all credit to these) and some Python scripts that have been created for this purpose.


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This documentation and most of the Python code are under active development.
